### **Memary**

- https://www.memarylabs.com/
- Memory for Agent Self-Improvement
  - Agents promote human-like reasoning and represent a significant leap towards AGI and understanding ourselves as humans. Memory is a key component of how we as humans approach tasks and should be given equal importance when building AI agents. Memary pioneers the use of action graphs to track agent resources so that your agent can continuously self-improve in production environments and become more reliable over time.
